      \ of Honna, Honna can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if\
      \ Honna isn't [incapacitated](Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated)\
      \ and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature\
      \ is instantly [petrified](Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Petrified). Otherwise,\
      \ a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is [restrained](Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained).\
      \ The [restrained](Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) creature must\
      \ repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming [petrified](Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Petrified)\
      \ on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until\
      \ the creature is freed by the [greater restoration](Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration-xphb.md)\
      \ spell or other magic.\n\nUnless [surprised](Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Surprised),\
      \ a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its\
      \ turn. If the creature does so, it can't see Honna until the start of its next\
      \ turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at Honna in\
      \ the meantime, it must immediately make the save.\n\nIf Honna sees itself reflected\
      \ on a polished surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light,\
      \ Honna is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze."
