      \ condition that the elder brain senses with its Creature Sense trait and establishes\
      \ a psychic link with the target. Until the link ends, the elder brain can perceive\
      \ everything the target senses. The target becomes aware that something is linked\
      \ to its mind once it no longer has the [incapacitated](Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated)\
      \ condition, and the elder brain can terminate the link at any time (no action\
      \ required). The target can use an action on its turn to attempt to break the\
      \ link, doing so with a successful DC 17 Charisma check. If the target breaks\
      \ the link this way, the target takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage. The link also\
      \ ends if the target and the elder brain are more than 1 mile apart. The elder\
      \ brain can form psychic links with up to ten creatures at a time."
