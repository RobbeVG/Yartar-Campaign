# [Refraction of Ilvaash](Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/refraction-of-ilvaash-pabtso.md)
*Source: Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk p. 197*  

Ilvaash was formed from the remains of the mind flayer god Ilsensine, the God-Brain. When Ilsensine left the Far Realm to establish a divine domain elsewhere, pieces of the God-Brain sloughed away and awoke to sentience. This is Ilvaash, the Dissonant Psyche.

The refraction of Ilvaash wields only a sliver of the godlet's power but is nevertheless a formidable foe.
