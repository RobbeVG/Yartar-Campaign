# [Goblin Psi Commander](Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/goblin-psi-commander-pabtso.md)
*Source: Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk p. 216*  

Goblin psi commanders are among the few psionic goblins who manage to fully control the power within themselves. Awakened to the total breadth of their psionic abilities, goblin psi commanders wield blades of pure psychic energy. They can throw barriers of mental force while toppling foes with a single, mind-splitting burst.

## Psionic Goblins

The specifics of how a psionic goblin comes to exist vary. Some are born, changed by energy leaking from the Far Realm. Others transform themselves with their psionic power or enter into agreements with other Aberrations, which help them transform in return for their service as shock troops. Regardless, the result is the same: a goblin with unnatural and barely contained psychic power.

Psionic goblins often struggle to handle the turbulent psychic energy within their minds and bodies. Those psionic goblins who learn how to safely tap into this psychic power are formidable forces in combat. Psionic goblins often augment their martial skills with telekinesis, and stealthy squads of psionic goblin warriors can communicate via telepathy, making them excellent infiltrators and ambushers.
